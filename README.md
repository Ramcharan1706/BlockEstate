# BlockEstate

BlockEstate is a decentralized property marketplace that enables secure house buying and selling using the Algorand blockchain. It leverages AlgoKit and PyTeal for smart contracts, ensuring transparent ownership transfer and tamper-proof transactions. The platform uses Node.js and TypeScript for a real-time web interface, with AlgoPy handling backend logic for a seamless user experience.

## üß∞ Prerequisites & Initial Setup

Before you begin working with BlockEstate, please ensure the following tools are installed on your machine. These are required to build, run, and interact with the decentralized property marketplace locally.

| Tool       | Version                 | Purpose                                |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Python** | `3.12.x` (exactly)      | Backend logic & smart contract tooling |
| **Docker** | Latest stable           | Local blockchain environment           |
| **Git**    | Latest stable           | Clone the repository                   |
| **Node.js**| `18.x` or newer         | Frontend build tools & CLI scripts     |
| **AlgoKit**| Latest stable (`algokit`) | Algorand development CLI               |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Python 3.13 or higher is **not** supported at this time. Please ensure you're using Python 3.12.

### üì¶ Get the Project Code

You can either clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.

#### Option A: Clone via Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/blockestate.git
cd blockestate
Option B: Download ZIP
Go to the GitHub repo

Click Code ‚Üí Download ZIP

Extract the ZIP and open the folder

‚öôÔ∏è Initial Project Setup
Bootstrap the full project environment (this installs dependencies, sets up Python virtualenv, and prepares environment files):

algokit project bootstrap all
(For smart contracts) Generate the environment file for localnet:


cd reallestate-contracts
algokit generate env-file -a target_network localnet
Build the entire project:


cd ..
algokit project run build
üí° If you update the source code or add new dependencies, re-run algokit project bootstrap all to keep your environment up to date.

üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project Locally
1. Open the project in your editor
Open VS Code (or your preferred code editor) and open the root project folder (blockestate).

2. Running the Frontend

cd projects/reallestate-frontend

# Copy the environment template to create your local .env file
cp .env.template .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
After running npm run dev, you will see a localhost URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

Ctrl + Click (or Cmd + Click on Mac) the URL in the terminal to open the frontend in your browser.

3. Running the Backend

cd ../../backend

# Install required Node.js modules
npm install express dotenv multer jsonwebtoken body-parser mongodb algosdk axios express-session cors

# Start the backend server
node server.js
The backend server will start and listen for API requests.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
Algorand blockchain with AlgoKit, PyTeal, and AlgoPy

Python with Poetry, Black, Ruff/Flake8, mypy, pytest, pip-audit

React + TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS, daisyUI, use-wallet

Node.js backend API with Express and related middleware

Testing & linting: Jest, Playwright, ESLint, Prettier

VS Code configured for developer productivity (.vscode folders included)

üîó Smart Contract Integration
Smart contracts reside in reallestate-contracts.

Frontend smart contract clients are generated automatically into projects/reallestate-frontend/src/contracts.

After compiling contracts, run:

npm run generate:app-clients
Use the generated clients in your React components.
